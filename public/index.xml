      <title>The Art of Sharing: Fiscal relations in the federation</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/cwf2021/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a federation the size and scope of Canada, the topic of fiscal inequalities among the provinces is especially fraught. With a referendum on equalization set for the fall in Alberta, the issue has heated up once again. In her book, The Art of Sharing: The Richer versus the Poorer Provinces since Confederation, author Mary Janigan makes the case that a willingness to share financial resources is in fact the real tie that has bound the federation together into the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event brings together a broad range of perspectives: a historian and journalist, a former Attorney General of BC, a former Finance Minister of Saskatchewan, an Alberta economist specializing in fiscal relations and a senior Manitoba intergovernmental official to consider how sharing works - or doesn&amp;rsquo;t work - in Canada, how budget decisions by each order of government across the country affect the services Canadians receive from their governments today and the cost into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join author Mary Janigan and host Colleen Collins, Vice-President Canada West Foundation for a discussion and Q and A session with panelists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Anton, Former Attorney-General BC and Canada West Foundation Board Member
Trevor Tombe, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Calgary
Kevin Doherty, Managing Director, Saskatchewan Prairie Sky Consulting and Canada West Foundation Board Member
Diane Gray, President &amp;amp; CEO, CentrePort Canada and Canada West Foundation Board Member&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alberta Futures: New fiscal territory, anchors and addressing the debt</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/spp_webinar_fiscal_chapter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alberta finds itself in new territory as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising debt levels, falling natural resource revenues, and structural changes to the economy suggests that this time is different. A long-term perspective is required to ensure that the province&amp;rsquo;s economy and government finances remain sustainable into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We invite you to join The School of Public Policy as we host the first in a series of webinars on our Alberta Futures Project. As part of this project we will be releasing a series of reports over the coming weeks in three broad areas: Alberta&amp;rsquo;s Economic Future, Alberta&amp;rsquo;s Fiscal Future and Alberta&amp;rsquo;s Health Care Future. In this webinar, our panel of experts will discuss their recent research into the Fiscal Future of Alberta, and how we can address the challenges currently facing our economy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alberta Economic Conditions Index</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/project/eci/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This index compiles monthly data from a variety of sourses to estimate real-time economic conditions in Alberta. It closely follows the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. These estimates will be periodically updated, and typically come with a two to three month lag before all the necessary monthly data is available from Statistics Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download a CSV file of the montly index values &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/trevortombe/alberta_eci/raw/master/ECI_Index_Data.csv&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Alberta&#39;s Opportunity: The Ins, Outs and Benefits of Greater Job Mobility</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/cdhowe_migration/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/cdhowe_migration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study in Brief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alberta should open its doors to job seekers with labour mobility reforms that will boost its economic fortunes post-COVID. The province has a unique opportunity to promote economic revival and longterm economic growth by ensuring that it is the most welcoming jurisdiction to talented workers and entrepreneurs from across Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gains from easing labour mobility restrictions are large. In this report, we find that for each 1,000 additional workers that move into Alberta in response to lower migration costs we estimate Alberta&amp;rsquo;s economy grows by 141 million dollars. And if migration costs fall by 1 percent across the board, we estimate gains of nearly 9 billion dollars. Better enabling Canadians to make this choice could provide a crucial support for Alberta&amp;rsquo;s economy at a time of transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though other provinces would benefit from similarly reducing barriers to potential movers, both Alberta and Canada as a whole can gain from unilateral moves by the province to lower the costs for Canadians who might contemplate plying their trade, exercising their profession, or operating their business from Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greater interprovincial mobility under a succession of regional and internal trade agreements has been beneficial and deepened the pool of workers available to Alberta. But obstacles remain for trades people and professionals who would come to Alberta. In particular, there are sometimes significant challenges to having their designation, training, or experience from other provinces seamlessly recognized. Recognizing those credentials, limiting the paperwork required of potential movers, and a more widespread recognition of national certifications and designations, such as those occurring under the Red Seal program, would enhance such mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the study shows that there is a close connection between fostering increased labour mobility and lower barriers to trade in services. For each 1 percent reduction in the cost of importing services from other provinces, we find Alberta&amp;rsquo;s economy grows by nearly 0.1 percent. For a 10 percent reduction in services-trade costs, GDP gains approach 1 percent - equivalent to nearly 3.5 billion dollars per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms we propose would facilitate mobility for employees and entrepreneurs alike. In short, when Canadians can move from one province to another with minimal barriers, the country as a whole benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
