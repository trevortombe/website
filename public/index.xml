      <title>The Long Slide Towards Fiscal Reckoning: Managing Alberta&#39;s Finances in an Age of Decline</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/blue_storm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edited by Duane Bratt, Richard Sutherland, and David Taras&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Book&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first scholarly analysis of the 2019 Alberta Election, which led to the victory of Jason Kenney&amp;rsquo;s United Conservative Party, and of the UCP&amp;rsquo;s first years in government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the United Conservative Party, under the leadership of Jason Kenney, unseated the New Democratic Party to form the provincial government of Alberta. A restoration of conservative power in a province that had seen the Progressive Conservatives win every election from 1971-2015, UCP quickly began to make political waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first scholarly analysis of the 2019 election and the first years of the UCP government, with special focus on the path of Jason Kenney&amp;rsquo;s rise to, and fall from, provincial political power. It opens with an examination of the election from a number of vantage points, including the campaign, polling, and online politics. It provides fascinating insight into internal UCP politics with chapters on the divisions within the party, gender and the UCP, and the symbolism of Kenney&amp;rsquo;s famous blue pickup truck. Explorations of oil and gas policy, the Energy War Room, Alberta&amp;rsquo;s budgets, health care, education, the public sector, Alberta&amp;rsquo;s cultural industries, and more provide unprecedented insight into the actions, motivations, and impacts of Kenney&amp;rsquo;s UCP Government in power. Contributions from top political watchers, journalists, and academics provide a wide range of methods and perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concluding with a survey of the impacts of COVID-19 in Alberta and a comparison between Jason Kenney and Doug Ford, Blue Storm is essential reading for everyone interested in Alberta politics and the tumultuous first years of the UCP government. Providing key insights from perspectives across the political spectrum, this book is a captivating deep-dive into an unprecedented party, its often controversial politics, and its unforgettable leader.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Federal Equalization Program as a Controversial and Contested Policy Success</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/eqsuccess/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/eqsuccess/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 12 in E. Lindquist, M. Howlett, G. Skogstad, G. Tellier, P. &amp;rsquo;t Hart. eds. Policy Success in Canada: Cases, Lessons, Challenges. Oxford University Press, 2022.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Created in 1957, the federal equalization program addresses the issue of horizontal fiscal imbalance and, more specifically, seeks to reduce interprovincial disparities in fiscal capacity. Excluding the three territories, which fall under Territorial Formula Financing, the equalization program allocates payments to the provinces whose fiscal capacity falls under a national average. This means that, in contrasts to the two other large federal transfers, the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer, equalization does not make annual payments to all the provinces. Simultaneously, since the creation of the program, all the provinces have received equalization payments for at least a few years. In 2019-2020, equalization payments to the five recipient  provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec) totaled nearly 20 billion dollars. In comparison, that fiscal year, the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer allocated about 40 and 15 billion dollars respectively to provinces and territories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we argue that equalization policy has been successful in reducing interprovincial inequalities while preserving the autonomy of the provinces, as equalization payments have no strings attached. This capacity to reconcile provincial autonomy with egalitarian goals rooted in shared social citizenship is featured in section 36(2) of the 1982 Constitutional Act: &amp;ldquo;Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.&amp;rdquo; A comparison with the United States, which does not have a stand-alone equalization program, allows us to show why this program makes a difference in the life of Canadians and in the proper functioning of the federation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may sound surprising to praise equalization policy in a time where strong voices, especially those coming from Alberta and Saskatchewan, are criticizing the program. In our chapter, we review these criticisms and show that many of them are grounded in basic misunderstandings about how equalization works. This gap between the negative discourse about equalization and the effective functioning of the program is a key political challenge our chapter addresses. Simultaneously, we recognize that some criticisms of equalization policy are legitimate, which is why we offer potential policy solutions to address them and improve this effective and important program Canadians should learn more about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Art of Sharing: Fiscal relations in the federation</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/cwf2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 12:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/cwf2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a federation the size and scope of Canada, the topic of fiscal inequalities among the provinces is especially fraught. With a referendum on equalization set for the fall in Alberta, the issue has heated up once again. In her book, The Art of Sharing: The Richer versus the Poorer Provinces since Confederation, author Mary Janigan makes the case that a willingness to share financial resources is in fact the real tie that has bound the federation together into the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This event brings together a broad range of perspectives: a historian and journalist, a former Attorney General of BC, a former Finance Minister of Saskatchewan, an Alberta economist specializing in fiscal relations and a senior Manitoba intergovernmental official to consider how sharing works - or doesn&amp;rsquo;t work - in Canada, how budget decisions by each order of government across the country affect the services Canadians receive from their governments today and the cost into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Join author Mary Janigan and host Colleen Collins, Vice-President Canada West Foundation for a discussion and Q and A session with panelists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Anton, Former Attorney-General BC and Canada West Foundation Board Member
Trevor Tombe, Associate Professor of Economics, University of Calgary
