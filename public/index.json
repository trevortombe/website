A restoration of conservative power in a province that had seen the Progressive Conservatives win every election from 1971-2015, UCP quickly began to make political waves.\nThis is the first scholarly analysis of the 2019 election and the first years of the UCP government, with special focus on the path of Jason Kenney\u0026rsquo;s rise to, and fall from, provincial political power. It opens with an examination of the election from a number of vantage points, including the campaign, polling, and online politics. It provides fascinating insight into internal UCP politics with chapters on the divisions within the party, gender and the UCP, and the symbolism of Kenney\u0026rsquo;s famous blue pickup truck. Explorations of oil and gas policy, the Energy War Room, Alberta\u0026rsquo;s budgets, health care, education, the public sector, Alberta\u0026rsquo;s cultural industries, and more provide unprecedented insight into the actions, motivations, and impacts of Kenney\u0026rsquo;s UCP Government in power. Contributions from top political watchers, journalists, and academics provide a wide range of methods and perspectives.\nConcluding with a survey of the impacts of COVID-19 in Alberta and a comparison between Jason Kenney and Doug Ford, Blue Storm is essential reading for everyone interested in Alberta politics and the tumultuous first years of the UCP government. Providing key insights from perspectives across the political spectrum, this book is a captivating deep-dive into an unprecedented party, its often controversial politics, and its unforgettable leader.\nWith Contributions By: Duane Bratt, Brad Clark, Brooks DeCillia, Roger Epp, Doug King, Jonathan Malloy, Tyler Nagel, Chaseten Remillard, Jean-Sebastien Rioux, Peter Ryan, Anthony M.

Lindquist, M. Howlett, G. Skogstad, G. Tellier, P. \u0026rsquo;t Hart. eds. Policy Success in Canada: Cases, Lessons, Challenges. Oxford University Press, 2022.\nCreated in 1957, the federal equalization program addresses the issue of horizontal fiscal imbalance and, more specifically, seeks to reduce interprovincial disparities in fiscal capacity. Excluding the three territories, which fall under Territorial Formula Financing, the equalization program allocates payments to the provinces whose fiscal capacity falls under a national average. This means that, in contrasts to the two other large federal transfers, the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer, equalization does not make annual payments to all the provinces. Simultaneously, since the creation of the program, all the provinces have received equalization payments for at least a few years. In 2019-2020, equalization payments to the five recipient provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Quebec) totaled nearly 20 billion dollars. In comparison, that fiscal year, the Canada Health Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer allocated about 40 and 15 billion dollars respectively to provinces and territories.\nIn this chapter, we argue that equalization policy has been successful in reducing interprovincial inequalities while preserving the autonomy of the provinces, as equalization payments have no strings attached. This capacity to reconcile provincial autonomy with egalitarian goals rooted in shared social citizenship is featured in section 36(2) of the 1982 Constitutional Act: \u0026ldquo;Parliament and the government of Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.\u0026rdquo; A comparison with the United States, which does not have a stand-alone equalization program, allows us to show why this program makes a difference in the life of Canadians and in the proper functioning of the federation.\nIt may sound surprising to praise equalization policy in a time where strong voices, especially those coming from Alberta and Saskatchewan, are criticizing the program. In our chapter, we review these criticisms and show that many of them are grounded in basic misunderstandings about how equalization works. This gap between the negative discourse about equalization and the effective functioning of the program is a key political challenge our chapter addresses. Simultaneously, we recognize that some criticisms of equalization policy are legitimate, which is why we offer potential policy solutions to address them and improve this effective and important program Canadians should learn more about.\n","date":1658383200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1658383200,"objectID":"a5799f8f0824025393780491d0ce3b7f","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/eqsuccess/","publishdate":"2022-07-21T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/eqsuccess/","section":"publication","summary":"Chapter 12 in E.

Much of this stems from aging populations, which slows economic growth and increases healthcare spending. While all provinces face this pressure, the scale varies considerably and the outlook for Atlantic Canada may be particularly concerning. After all, the pace of aging is higher in this region - especially so in Newfoundland and Labrador. But even within this region there are important differences between each province's circumstances. This paper explores these pressures by quantifying both the magnitude of each province's fiscal challenge and the potential options available to ensure sustainable public finances. Building on the methodology developed by Tombe (2020), combined with the latest data and projections, I estimate the gap between provincial expenditures and revenues in the coming decades is significant but manageable. I also find a notable difference between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, which have a relatively favourable outlook, and New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador, which do not. Various fiscal reforms, including change to federal transfers and provincial revenue and expenditure policies, are available to governments to address these long-run challenges.","tags":[],"title":"Fiscal Sustainability and Diverging Fortunes in Atlantic Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656655200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656655200,"objectID":"7ac3fc6405a8b4994d374433ad9ab851","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/supply_shocks/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/supply_shocks/","section":"publication","summary":"Canada's inflation rate rose from 3.1 percent in June 2021 to 8.1 percent one year later.

Using detailed price and quantity data, we separately identify demand- from supply-driven inflation. We find two-thirds of Canada's accelerating inflation since Q1 2020 is supply-driven, which complicates monetary policy. Another supply shock --- large increases in bank reserves --- may complicate it further. We estimate that ample reserves and rising interest rates may cause large financial losses for the Bank of Canada. This creates novel reputational and communications challenges for the Bank and highlights underappreciated connections between monetary and fiscal policy. These twin supply shocks --- to consumer products and overnight balances --- are important aspects of Canada's recent inflation and monetary policy experiences.","tags":[],"title":"The Twin Supply Shocks to Canada's Post-Pandemic Inflation and Monetary Policy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643612400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643612400,"objectID":"f45eae9c7fb260346cba4d592746d90f","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/art_sharing/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/art_sharing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Book Review: The Art of Sharing by Mary Janigan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638342000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638342000,"objectID":"c1c5f7985d2631a2191e1e0b55a9687b","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/who_pays/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/who_pays/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Book Review: Who Pays for Canada?

Explicit transfers, such as Canada's equalization program, redistribute funds directly. Countless federal revenue and spending programs do so indirectly. Like capital flows between countries, such transfers interact with trade and affect the distribution of economic activity within and between subnational jurisdictions. Previous research has largely abstracted from trade considerations; we fill this gap. With the aid of a rich quantitative model and detailed data on within-country trade and financial flows, we uncover important effects of fiscal transfers on provincial income, migration and national GDP in Canada. The effects are large. Transfers lower Alberta's real income by over 8% and its population by over 12% and increase Prince Edward Island's real income by 30% and its population by 50%. As employment shifts to lower productivity regions, we find transfers shrink Canada's real GDP by 0.8% and income-sensitive transfers do so by as much as 1.2%--equal to $19 to $28 billion today. Finally, fiscal transfers affect the size and distribution of gains from internal trade liberalization and spread gains across all regions, even if policy (like the New West Partnership) liberalizes trade among only some.","tags":[],"title":"Fiscal Integration with Internal Trade: Quantifying the Effects of Equalizing Transfers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Bev Dahlby"],"categories":null,"content":"Alberta finds itself in new territory as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

The benefits of infrastructure corridors, however, go far beyond pipelines. By reducing interprovincial and international trade costs, multimodal infrastructure corridors of road, rail, utilities and communications can potentially create large economic benefits. In this paper, we quantify the potential economic gains in Alberta from reductions in trade costs and identify the importance of improved access to lower cost transportation options like rail for select commodities. Combining rich data on interprovincial trade flows with mode-specific shipment data on volumes, values, and shipment costs, we find that rail shipments are a lower cost means of exporting goods for long-distance trade. We estimate increased rail penetration lowers trade costs by roughly 0.3 per cent for each percentage point of rail's share of shipments. We also estimate economic gains from lower trade costs. We find that lowering trade costs substantially increases Alberta's real GDP through its impact on international and interprovincial trade flows. Infrastructure capacity is particularly valuable, as we find that increasing the share of exports shipped by rail by ten percentage points may increase Alberta's GDP by nearly 1.5 per cent in the short-run and over 2.5 per cent in the long-run - equivalent to over $9 billion per year in economic activity.","tags":[],"title":"Implications of an Infrastructure Corridor for Alberta's Economy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This is a work in progress.\n\rLabour Force Survey Each month Statistics Canada releases their Labour Force Survey.

But an aging population and declining real-estate activity may, over the medium and long run, create pressures that current policy is not well equipped to handle. This paper estimates the long-run fiscal situation for the province and finds the status quo unsustainable. Revenue growth lags behind both the overall economy and program spending. The gap between spending and revenue will, over time, lead to unsustainable debt levels. Immediate and permanent increases in revenue or decreases in spending on the order of 3% of GDP are necessary to ensure that B.C.'s debt-to-GDP ratio does not grow without bound. This is equivalent to increasing sales taxes by 8 percentage points or decreasing program spending by nearly 17%. Roughly half the long-run gap between projected revenue and spending is due to slow revenue growth and the other half due to rising health expenditures. Though status quo policy is unsustainable, a wide variety of policy responses are available. This report explores several long-run fiscal scenarios to examine the challenges facing the province, the wide variety of policy responses, and the scope for new large-scale spending initiatives like a basic income program. Gradual changes made today will not only ensure fiscal sustainability but also allow the province to consider expanding social spending programs in a responsible manner.","tags":[],"title":"Financing the Future: Options for Long-Run Debt and Spending Sustainability in British Columbia","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606924800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606924800,"objectID":"a2f3e07eb620a2eb135ac625044f463b","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/esna_dec2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-02T09:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/esna_dec2020/","section":"talk","summary":"ESNA's annual Economic Outlook Conference has become known as a key place to gather and discuss the economic state of Alberta, Canada and the world.

But obstacles remain for trades people and professionals who would come to Alberta. In particular, there are sometimes significant challenges to having their designation, training, or experience from other provinces seamlessly recognized. Recognizing those credentials, limiting the paperwork required of potential movers, and a more widespread recognition of national certifications and designations, such as those occurring under the Red Seal program, would enhance such mobility.\nIn addition, the study shows that there is a close connection between fostering increased labour mobility and lower barriers to trade in services.

The COVID-19 pandemic certainly qualifies as a major crisis, not only in the specific public health domain, but also for its social, economic, and fiscal dimensions. As such, the pandemic comes with potential for change in the policies, processes, and territorial politics of Canadian federalism. Change can occur in many different ways: through the strengthening or exacerbating of pre-existing patterns; the re-shaping of public debate; the introduction of new policy ideas; the establishment of new precedents; the opening of windows for reform; and the emergence of political and/or economic incentives to alter existing programs, rules, and institutions. This paper examines the potential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on six key dimensions of Canadian federalism: social protection; intergovernmental relations; fiscal federalism; emergency powers; Quebec nationalism and politics; and regional alienation in Alberta.","tags":[],"title":"The COVID-19 Crisis and Canadian Federalism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596693600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596693600,"objectID":"4422a14ba23ea8fc42852e212cf6448b","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/cwf_whatnow/","publishdate":"2020-08-06T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cwf_whatnow/","section":"publication","summary":"The pressing need to review this program (and, indeed, many other federal-provincial fiscal arrangements) has been revealed by the COVID-19 disruptions.

Worker migration is central to this transformation, with almost 300 million workers living and working outside their area or sector of (\textit{hukou}) registration by 2015. Combining rich individual-level data on worker migration with a spatial general equilibrium model of China's economy, we estimate the reductions in internal migration costs between 2000 and 2015, and quantify the contributions of these cost reductions to economic growth, structural change, and regional income convergence. We find that over the fifteen-year period China's internal migration costs fell by forty-five percent, with the cost of moving from agricultural rural areas to non-agricultural urban ones falling even more. In addition to contributing substantially to growth, these migration cost changes account for the majority of the reallocation of workers out of agriculture and the drop in regional inequality. We compare the effect of migration policy changes with other important economic factors, including changes in trade costs, capital market distortions, average cost of capital, and productivity. While each contributes meaningfully to growth, migration policy is central to China's structural change and regional income convergence. We also find the recent slow-down in aggregate economic growth between 2010 and 2015 is associated with smaller reduction in inter-provincial migration costs and a larger role of capital accumulation.","tags":[],"title":"The Effect of Migration Policy on Growth, Structural Change, and Regional Inequality in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Chen","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596088800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596088800,"objectID":"aed6e71a288632314be33d5e0d7ae16c","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/canada_misallocation/","publishdate":"2020-07-30T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/canada_misallocation/","section":"publication","summary":"How efficiently are workers, investment capital, and production distributed across firms in Canada?

We find the dispersion of marginal returns to both capital and labour across firms have increased significantly during this period, suggesting allocative efficiency is deteriorating. Using a rich but tractable multi-sector model of heterogeneous firms, we find this rising misallocation accounts for over three-quarters of the increased productivity gap between Canada and the United States over this period.

But vast differences in fiscal and economic circumstances across provinces makes federal arrangements difficult to design. We argue that intergovernmental power dynamics and the principle of provincial autonomy are particularly important considerations in thinking about fiscal federalism post COVID-19.","tags":[],"title":"A Critical Juncture in Fiscal Federalism?

Based on recently released analysis published by the IMF, whose research team I was a part, internal trade costs add significantly to the price we pay for goods and services and potentially shrink Canada's economy by nearly 4 per cent - an amount equivalent to nearly $6,000 per family. There's much that governments can do to help. I'll discuss some of the pros and cons of Alberta's recent moves to liberalize trade and ask what more Canada's federal government can and should do. In addition, a National Infrastructure Corridor is gaining traction across Canada. This initiative is not just a market access issue for oil and gas, but could improve the trade flows for many other commodities.

Despite early hopes that transfer arrangements were 'a final and unalterable settlement' of provincial demands, complex economic and political pressures forced successive governments to negotiate. To explore this history and Canada's various transfer programs, I compile uniquely detailed data from Confederation to today. Explicit transfers to provincial governments are large, but more equally distributed today than throughout most of Canada's history. I also propose a uniform methodology to quantify and analyze both explicit and implicit fiscal transfers. Overall, federal tax and spending activities redistribute just under 2 per cent of Canada's GDP across provinces; but this too is less than any point in the past six decades. This data, analysis and brief historical review reveal why today's transfer programs are designed as they are, what pressures they must withstand, and what future reforms might consider.","tags":[],"title":"Final and Unalterable - But Up for Negotiation: Federal-Provincial Transfers in Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Xiaodong Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546326000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546326000,"objectID":"e0db2320a3f86d72a1cfcc5fdfcfbaf3","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/china-migration/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/china-migration/","section":"publication","summary":"We study how goods- and labor-market frictions affect aggregate labor productivity in China.

An aging population will increase government spending significantly, and tax revenue will fail to keep pace. A persistent dependence on resource royalties adds to the uncertainty. And even if current plans to balance early in the next decade succeed, fiscal pressures will mount and deficits balloon.\nThis paper examines long-term projections for resource royalties, federal transfer payments, investment income, property taxes, tuition revenue, health and education spending and debt service costs, and forecasts a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040. At 4 per cent of the province\u0026rsquo;s economy, that\u0026rsquo;s equivalent to more than $14 billion today. A deficit of this magnitude, combined with capital investments that also add to debt, could raise the ratio of net debt to GDP to almost 50 per cent by 2040 - higher than any point in Alberta\u0026rsquo;s history. And rising debt means rising interest costs. By 2040, interest payments alone may balloon to more than $22 billion, or 17 per cent of government\u0026rsquo;s total revenue.\nA number of options are available to head off this fiscal crisis, but there are no easy choices. Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal gap - defined as the permanent and immediate reduction in expenditures or increase in revenues required to ensure sustainable future debt levels - is equivalent to 2.7 per cent of GDP. For perspective, that means cutting government expenditures by $1 out of every $6 spent or introducing a 10 per cent sales tax. But moderation, rather than extremism, is the best long-term approach. A combination of restrained spending growth and modest new revenues - rather than focusing solely on either tax increases or harsh spending cuts - will create a sustainable economic future for Alberta.\nBroader tax reform should also be on the table. A sales tax, for example, could be used to lower income taxes and lessen our dependence on volatile resource royalties. On the spending side, careful cost-benefit analyses and assessment of delivery efficiency could reveal plenty of opportunities to reduce spending. This report explores many options.\nWhatever the path forward, securing Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal future requires a long-term perspective and rigorous planning. Government should regularly measure and report on its long-term fiscal situation. It should set clear goals and monitor progress towards achieving them. Along the way, government must recognize what works and what does not, without being afraid to try new measures if necessary.\nAlberta\u0026rsquo;s unique fiscal challenges can be managed, and the province\u0026rsquo;s fiscal gap can be eliminated. But we must abandon short-term political thinking and do things differently. We must plan for a sustainable fiscal future.\n","date":1541052000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541052000,"objectID":"ad4f3e5da8542b493301106d04e8e28f","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/fiscal-future/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fiscal-future/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal policies are unsustainable.\nThe province has neither a revenue problem nor a spending problem; it has a budget problem.

At the same time, industries in the territories are highly reliant on access to export markets - especially the large and growing resource sectors of the region. But these trade flows face significant costs that improved infrastructure may help mitigate. A northern transportation corridor could help, and has recently gained prominence following recent reports and hearings by the Senate of Canada. The potential gains are large.\nThis paper estimates trade costs in Canada\u0026rsquo;s North. We find policy-relevant trade costs (those trade costs that policy changes may help lower) are substantial. The regulatory differences, time delays and lower infrastructure quality that inhibit trade add between 20 to 30 per cent to the cost of a delivered good for Yukon and Northwest Territories and over 60 per cent for Nunavut. Infrastructure may be a large cause of higher trade costs. We find that distance-related costs are 45 per cent higher per kilometre for trade with a territory than for trade between two provinces.\nThe region\u0026rsquo;s economy, productivity, income and investment are significantly lower as a result. Using a detailed model of the Canadian economy, we find that lowering these barriers - such as through improving northern transportation infrastructure - could add up to $6.5 billion to Canada\u0026rsquo;s GDP, with most of that gain occurring in the territories. For the Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories the gains equal about $40,000 per person, which is a 50 per cent increase in productivity.\nThe Senate\u0026rsquo;s advocacy for reducing trade barriers is encouraging and the federal government broadly supports knocking down these barriers. It is time for all three levels of government to work together to create policies on, and funding for, improved infrastructure in Canada\u0026rsquo;s North and near-North.\n","date":1529301600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529301600,"objectID":"36098bf55fa71ea93401f2a4c329e8e5","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/north/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/north/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Challenged by remote locations, small populations, rugged terrain and (at times) difficult climate conditions, Canada\u0026rsquo;s territories rely heavily on imported goods to maintain their standards of living.

Our findings highlight the importance of interactions between incentives created by a disclosure program and firms' internal organizational practices.","tags":[],"title":"Quality Disclosure Programs and Internal Organizational Practices: Evidence from Airline Flight Delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1426053600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1426053600,"objectID":"dee5bcd2172f4c3f7fe7698eaf637b73","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/better-off/","publishdate":"2015-03-11T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/better-off/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Better off Dead: 'Value Added' in Economic Policy Debates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loren Brandt","Trevor Tombe","Xiadong Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420095600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420095600,"objectID":"cead7290f54af79cd9efd2a0b81ffd19","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/china-distortions/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/china-distortions/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we measure TFP losses in China's non-agricultural economy associated with labour and capital misallocation across provinces and sectors between 1985-2007. We also decompose the overall loss into factor market distortions within provinces (between state and non-state sectors) and distortions between provinces (within sectors). Over the entire period, misallocation lowers aggregate non-agricultural TFP by an average of twenty percent. However, after initially declining, these losses increased appreciably beginning in the mid-1990s. This reversal can be attributed almost exclusively to increasing misallocation of capital between state and non-state sectors within provinces, while losses from between province misallocation remained fairly constant. We argue that the recent increase in capital market distortions is related to government policies that encourage investments in the state sector at the expense of investments in the more productive non-state sector.","tags":[],"title":"Factor Market Distortions Across Time, Space, and Sectors in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1394776800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1394776800,"objectID":"bb51d1b067798d80972177699b780c6f","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/energy-trade/","publishdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/energy-trade/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Taming of the Skew: Facts On Canada's Energy Trade","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Jennifer Winter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362121200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362121200,"objectID":"4cfcad876bc4fd47d6b3bd9e5d6784d4","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/neutrality/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/neutrality/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Importance of Policy Neutrality for Lowering Greenhouse Gas Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wardah Naim","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357023600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357023600,"objectID":"abcc5c239c85c3808234db3b5cf1a9eb","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/appreciation/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/appreciation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Appreciate the Appreciation: Imported Inputs and Concern over Dutch Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michelle Alexopoulos","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325401200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325401200,"objectID":"7ceaf83d5e6ab0c23decee1a5fbde50c","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/mgmt-matters/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mgmt-matters/","section":"publication","summary":"To evaluate the effect of managerial innovations on the economy, a series of new indicators capturing these advances is constructed. Three findings emerge from the analysis. First, following a positive managerial shock, output and productivity significantly increase and hours modestly rise in the short run. Second, management innovations are generally as important as non-managerial ones in explaining movements in these variables at business cycle frequencies. Finally, product and process innovations help to promote the development of new managerial techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Management matters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Donald Dewees","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1322722800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1322722800,"objectID":"a4f6bcc14283f1e021e09604884a2dec","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/submeters/","publishdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/submeters/","section":"publication","summary":"With a substantial fraction of the population insulated from energy price signals in bulk-metered apartment and condominium buildings, some jurisdictions are exploring mandatory metering of individual suites to encourage electricity conservation. This study finds that sub-metering in a Toronto condominium building reduces electricity usage by 20 percent. However, the costs of metering and customer service largely offset the electricity cost savings, and so the private net benefits are small or negative. The social net benefits depend strongly on the value assigned to externalities from generation. Social net benefits in our baseline results are closer to 5 percent than to 20 percent, and could be negative in many buildings.","tags":[],"title":"The Impact of Sub-Metering on Condominium Electricity Demand","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Adding a figure Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne\r Two\r Three\r\nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
