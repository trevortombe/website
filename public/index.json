Explicit transfers, such as Canada's equalization program, redistribute funds directly, and countless federal revenue and spending programs do so indirectly. And like capital flows between countries, such transfers interact with trade and affect the distribution of economic activity within and between provinces. Previous research has largely abstracted from trade considerations; we fill this gap. With the aid of a rich quantitative model and detailed data on within-country trade and financial flows, we uncover important effects of fiscal transfers on provincial income, internal trade flows, migration, and national GDP. The effects are large. Transfers lower Alberta's real income by over 8 per cent and its population by over 12 per cent, and increase PEI's real income by 30 per cent and its population by nearly 50 per cent. We further find transfers misallocate labour across provinces and lower Canada's real GDP by over 0.8 per cent -- equivalent to nearly $19 billion per year today. Finally, fiscal transfers spread gains from trade across all regions, even if policy (like the New West Partnership) liberalizes trade only among some.","tags":[],"title":"Fiscal Integration with Internal Trade: Quantifying the Effects of Equalizing Transfers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tongtong Hao","Ruiqi Sun","Trevor Tombe","Xiaodong Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580281200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580281200,"objectID":"6620e2000f4fcd2d342fe281352db02c","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/china_migration/","publishdate":"2020-01-29T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/china_migration/","section":"publication","summary":"Between 2000 and 2015, China's aggregate income quadrupled, its provincial income inequality fell by a third, and its share of employment in agriculture fell by half. Worker migration is central to this transformation, with almost 300 million workers living and working outside their area or sector of (\textit{hukou}) registration by 2015. Combining rich individual-level data on worker migration with a spatial general equilibrium model of China's economy, we estimate the reductions in internal migration costs between 2000 and 2015, and quantify the contributions of these cost reductions to economic growth, structural change, and regional income convergence. We find that over the fifteen-year period China's internal migration costs fell by forty-five percent, with the cost of moving from agricultural rural areas to non-agricultural urban ones falling even more. In addition to contributing substantially to growth, these migration cost changes account for the majority of the reallocation of workers out of agriculture and the drop in regional inequality. We compare the effect of migration policy changes with other important economic factors, including changes in trade costs, capital market distortions, average cost of capital, and productivity. While each contributes meaningfully to growth, migration policy is central to China's structural change and regional income convergence. We also find the recent slow-down in aggregate economic growth between 2010 and 2015 is associated with smaller reduction in inter-provincial migration costs and a larger role of capital accumulation.","tags":[],"title":"The Effect of Migration Policy on Growth, Structural Change, and Regional Inequality in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580194800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580194800,"objectID":"3905b1924a4ae145c347730016cc6321","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/budget1995/policy-forum-expenditures-efficiency-and-distribution-advice-for-canadas-43rd-parliament/","publishdate":"2020-01-28T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/budget1995/policy-forum-expenditures-efficiency-and-distribution-advice-for-canadas-43rd-parliament/","section":"publication","summary":"Chapter 5 of *The Budget that Changed Canada: Essays on the 25th Anniversary of the 1995 Budget*, forthcoming.","tags":[],"title":"Effective, Flexible, and Affordable: Towards a New System of Federal-Provincial Transfers in Budget 1995","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579276800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579276800,"objectID":"a5d30be970504bc17335be924b01b88a","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/talk/cabe_jan2020/","publishdate":"2020-01-17T09:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/talk/cabe_jan2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Since the federal election saw the Conservatives sweep all but one seat across Alberta and Saskatchewan, talk of 'Wexit' has ramped up.

There is significant scope to build on the new Canadian Free Trade Agreement to more explicitly identify key trade restrictions, resolve differences, and agree on cooperative solutions.","tags":[],"title":"Internal Trade in Canada: The Case for Liberalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tracy Snoddon","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561010400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561010400,"objectID":"747ce90a562aea72603553d0c1e22f15","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/ctax_equal/","publishdate":"2019-06-20T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ctax_equal/","section":"publication","summary":"Carbon taxes are not only an effi cient tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, but they are also an increasingly important source of government revenue.

Despite early hopes that transfer arrangements were 'a final and unalterable settlement' of provincial demands, complex economic and political pressures forced successive governments to negotiate. To explore this history and Canada's various transfer programs, I compile uniquely detailed data from Confederation to today. Explicit transfers to provincial governments are large, but more equally distributed today than throughout most of Canada's history. I also propose a uniform methodology to quantify and analyze both explicit and implicit fiscal transfers. Overall, federal tax and spending activities redistribute just under 2 per cent of Canada's GDP across provinces; but this too is less than any point in the past six decades. This data, analysis and brief historical review reveal why today's transfer programs are designed as they are, what pressures they must withstand, and what future reforms might consider.","tags":[],"title":"Final and Unalterable - But Up for Negotiation: Federal-Provincial Transfers in Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Xiaodong Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546326000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546326000,"objectID":"e0db2320a3f86d72a1cfcc5fdfcfbaf3","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/china-migration/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/china-migration/","section":"publication","summary":"We study how goods- and labor-market frictions affect aggregate labor productivity in China.

An aging population will increase government spending significantly, and tax revenue will fail to keep pace. A persistent dependence on resource royalties adds to the uncertainty. And even if current plans to balance early in the next decade succeed, fiscal pressures will mount and deficits balloon.\nThis paper examines long-term projections for resource royalties, federal transfer payments, investment income, property taxes, tuition revenue, health and education spending and debt service costs, and forecasts a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040. At 4 per cent of the province\u0026rsquo;s economy, that\u0026rsquo;s equivalent to more than $14 billion today. A deficit of this magnitude, combined with capital investments that also add to debt, could raise the ratio of net debt to GDP to almost 50 per cent by 2040 - higher than any point in Alberta\u0026rsquo;s history. And rising debt means rising interest costs. By 2040, interest payments alone may balloon to more than $22 billion, or 17 per cent of government\u0026rsquo;s total revenue.\nA number of options are available to head off this fiscal crisis, but there are no easy choices. Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal gap - defined as the permanent and immediate reduction in expenditures or increase in revenues required to ensure sustainable future debt levels - is equivalent to 2.7 per cent of GDP. For perspective, that means cutting government expenditures by $1 out of every $6 spent or introducing a 10 per cent sales tax. But moderation, rather than extremism, is the best long-term approach. A combination of restrained spending growth and modest new revenues - rather than focusing solely on either tax increases or harsh spending cuts - will create a sustainable economic future for Alberta.\nBroader tax reform should also be on the table. A sales tax, for example, could be used to lower income taxes and lessen our dependence on volatile resource royalties. On the spending side, careful cost-benefit analyses and assessment of delivery efficiency could reveal plenty of opportunities to reduce spending. This report explores many options.\nWhatever the path forward, securing Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal future requires a long-term perspective and rigorous planning. Government should regularly measure and report on its long-term fiscal situation. It should set clear goals and monitor progress towards achieving them. Along the way, government must recognize what works and what does not, without being afraid to try new measures if necessary.\nAlberta\u0026rsquo;s unique fiscal challenges can be managed, and the province\u0026rsquo;s fiscal gap can be eliminated. But we must abandon short-term political thinking and do things differently.

At the same time, industries in the territories are highly reliant on access to export markets - especially the large and growing resource sectors of the region. But these trade flows face significant costs that improved infrastructure may help mitigate. A northern transportation corridor could help, and has recently gained prominence following recent reports and hearings by the Senate of Canada. The potential gains are large.\nThis paper estimates trade costs in Canada\u0026rsquo;s North. We find policy-relevant trade costs (those trade costs that policy changes may help lower) are substantial. The regulatory differences, time delays and lower infrastructure quality that inhibit trade add between 20 to 30 per cent to the cost of a delivered good for Yukon and Northwest Territories and over 60 per cent for Nunavut. Infrastructure may be a large cause of higher trade costs. We find that distance-related costs are 45 per cent higher per kilometre for trade with a territory than for trade between two provinces.\nThe region\u0026rsquo;s economy, productivity, income and investment are significantly lower as a result. Using a detailed model of the Canadian economy, we find that lowering these barriers - such as through improving northern transportation infrastructure - could add up to $6.5 billion to Canada\u0026rsquo;s GDP, with most of that gain occurring in the territories. For the Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories the gains equal about $40,000 per person, which is a 50 per cent increase in productivity.\nThe Senate\u0026rsquo;s advocacy for reducing trade barriers is encouraging and the federal government broadly supports knocking down these barriers. It is time for all three levels of government to work together to create policies on, and funding for, improved infrastructure in Canada\u0026rsquo;s North and near-North.\n","date":1529301600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529301600,"objectID":"36098bf55fa71ea93401f2a4c329e8e5","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/north/","publishdate":"2018-06-18T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/north/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Challenged by remote locations, small populations, rugged terrain and (at times) difficult climate conditions, Canada\u0026rsquo;s territories rely heavily on imported goods to maintain their standards of living.

A northern transportation corridor could help, and has recently gained prominence following recent reports and hearings by the Senate of Canada.","tags":[],"title":"Opening Canada's North: A Study of Trade Costs in the Territories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524031200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524031200,"objectID":"39881032d7ed0cd43d03b1cf653638ed","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/ontario360/","publishdate":"2018-04-18T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ontario360/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Climate Policy Transition Briefing: An Evidence-Based Climate Policy for Ontario","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ron Kneebone","Norman McIntyre","Tim O'Neill","Grace Southwick","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1510729200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510729200,"objectID":"10fc60d8dcb0383e52975e7084637651","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/yfap/","publishdate":"2017-11-15T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yfap/","section":"publication","summary":"To support building a healthy financial future, the Yukon government assembled an independent Financial Advisory Panel to provide the government with options for future financial planning.","tags":[],"title":"Yukon Financial Advisory Panel Final Report","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Alberta\u0026rsquo;s Fiscal Future (AFF) project is a two-year research/public engagement initiative providing the public and policy makers with in-depth analyses of Alberta\u0026rsquo;s fiscal situation and policy options to address it.\nThe main site for the project is at the School of Public Policy.\n","date":1509084000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509084000,"objectID":"b817b5a84a304489fab83e3c60d465c1","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/project/ab-fiscal-future/","publishdate":"2017-10-27T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/project/ab-fiscal-future/","section":"project","summary":"The Alberta's Fiscal Future (AFF) project is a two-year research/public engagement initiative providing the public and policy makers with in-depth analyses of Alberta's fiscal situation and policy options to address it.","tags":["Alberta Economy"],"title":"Alberta's Fiscal Future","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sarah Dobson","G.

To answer these questions, we exploit unique Canadian data to measure internal trade costs in a variety of waysthey are large and vary across sectors and provinces. To quantify their consequences for welfare and productivity, we use a recent multi-sector trade model featuring rich inputoutput relationships. We find interprovincial trade is an important contributor to Canada's GDP and welfare, though there are significant costs to such trade. Reducing interprovincial trade costs by 10% yields aggregate gains of 0.9%; eliminating our preferred estimates of costs, gains average between 3% and 7% -- equivalent to real GDP gains between $50 billion and $130 billion. Finally, as policy reforms are often sector specific, we liberalize sectors one at a time and find gains are largest in highly interconnected industries.","tags":[],"title":"Internal Trade, Productivity, and Interconnected Industries: A Quantitative Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Jennifer Winter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1435730400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435730400,"objectID":"730856333bc51ef9270f9b8d6399a73a","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/enviro-policy/","publishdate":"2015-07-01T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/enviro-policy/","section":"publication","summary":"Firm-level idiosyncratic policy distortions misallocate resources between firms, lowering aggregate productivity.

Qualitatively, we demonstrate that intensity standards are always inferior to uniform taxes, as they misallocate both dirty and clean inputs across firms and sectors, which lowers productivity.

We also decompose the overall loss into factor market distortions within provinces (between state and non-state sectors) and distortions between provinces (within sectors). Over the entire period, misallocation lowers aggregate non-agricultural TFP by an average of twenty percent. However, after initially declining, these losses increased appreciably beginning in the mid-1990s. This reversal can be attributed almost exclusively to increasing misallocation of capital between state and non-state sectors within provinces, while losses from between province misallocation remained fairly constant. We argue that the recent increase in capital market distortions is related to government policies that encourage investments in the state sector at the expense of investments in the more productive non-state sector.","tags":[],"title":"Factor Market Distortions Across Time, Space, and Sectors in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1394776800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1394776800,"objectID":"bb51d1b067798d80972177699b780c6f","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/energy-trade/","publishdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/energy-trade/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Taming of the Skew: Facts On Canada's Energy Trade","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Jennifer Winter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1362121200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1362121200,"objectID":"4cfcad876bc4fd47d6b3bd9e5d6784d4","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/neutrality/","publishdate":"2013-03-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/neutrality/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Importance of Policy Neutrality for Lowering Greenhouse Gas Emissions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wardah Naim","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1357023600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1357023600,"objectID":"abcc5c239c85c3808234db3b5cf1a9eb","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/appreciation/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/appreciation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Appreciate the Appreciation: Imported Inputs and Concern over Dutch Disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michelle Alexopoulos","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325401200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325401200,"objectID":"7ceaf83d5e6ab0c23decee1a5fbde50c","permalink":"https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/mgmt-matters/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mgmt-matters/","section":"publication","summary":"To evaluate the effect of managerial innovations on the economy, a series of new indicators capturing these advances is constructed.

However, the costs of metering and customer service largely offset the electricity cost savings, and so the private net benefits are small or negative. The social net benefits depend strongly on the value assigned to externalities from generation. Social net benefits in our baseline results are closer to 5 percent than to 20 percent, and could be negative in many buildings.","tags":[],"title":"The Impact of Sub-Metering on Condominium Electricity Demand","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Adding a figure Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
