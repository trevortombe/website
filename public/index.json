Despite early hopes that transfer arrangements were 'a final and unalterable settlement' of provincial demands, complex economic and political pressures forced successive governments to negotiate. To explore this history and Canada's various transfer programs, I compile uniquely detailed data from Confederation to today. Explicit transfers to provincial governments are large, but more equally distributed today than throughout most of Canada's history. I also propose a uniform methodology to quantify and analyze both explicit and implicit fiscal transfers. Overall, federal tax and spending activities redistribute just under 2 per cent of Canada's GDP across provinces; but this too is less than any point in the past six decades. This data, analysis and brief historical review reveal why today's transfer programs are designed as they are, what pressures they must withstand, and what future reforms might consider.","tags":[],"title":"Final and Unalterable - But Up for Negociation: Federal-Provincial Transfers in Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a work in progress.\n\rEach month Statistics Canada releases their labour force survey data.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a collection of my random graphics.\n","date":1546326000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546326000,"objectID":"6ed4bc63607a7caa14b5d3a38d46ff13","permalink":"/project/lfs/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/lfs/","section":"project","summary":"Summarizing the latest labour market data for Alberta.","tags":["Alberta Economy"],"title":"Labour Force Survey","type":"project"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe","Xiaodong Zhu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546326000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546326000,"objectID":"e0db2320a3f86d72a1cfcc5fdfcfbaf3","permalink":"/publication/china-migration/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/china-migration/","section":"publication","summary":"We study how goods- and labor-market frictions affect aggregate labor productivity in China.

We also decompose the overall loss into factor market distortions within provinces (between state and non-state sectors) and distortions between provinces (within sectors). Over the entire period, misallocation lowers aggregate non-agricultural TFP by an average of twenty percent. However, after initially declining, these losses increased appreciably beginning in the mid-1990s. This reversal can be attributed almost exclusively to increasing misallocation of capital between state and non-state sectors within provinces, while losses from between province misallocation remained fairly constant. We argue that the recent increase in capital market distortions is related to government policies that encourage investments in the state sector at the expense of investments in the more productive non-state sector.","tags":[],"title":"Factor Market Distortions Across Time, Space, and Sectors in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1394776800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1394776800,"objectID":"bb51d1b067798d80972177699b780c6f","permalink":"/publication/energy-trade/","publishdate":"2014-03-14T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/energy-trade/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"The Taming of the Skew: Facts On Canada's Energy Trade","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michelle Alexopoulos","Trevor Tombe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325401200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325401200,"objectID":"7ceaf83d5e6ab0c23decee1a5fbde50c","permalink":"/publication/mgmt-matters/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mgmt-matters/","section":"publication","summary":"To evaluate the effect of managerial innovations on the economy, a series of new indicators capturing these advances is constructed.
