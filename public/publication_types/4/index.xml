      <title>Alberta&#39;s Opportunity: The Ins, Outs and Benefits of Greater Job Mobility</title>

      <description>Study in Brief
Alberta should open its doors to job seekers with labour mobility reforms that will boost its economic fortunes post-COVID. The province has a unique opportunity to promote economic revival and longterm economic growth by ensuring that it is the most welcoming jurisdiction to talented workers and entrepreneurs from across Canada.
The gains from easing labour mobility restrictions are large. In this report, we find that for each 1,000 additional workers that move into Alberta in response to lower migration costs we estimate Alberta&amp;rsquo;s economy grows by 141 million dollars.</description>

      <description>This working paper is the first output of the ActiveCITY Collective. ActiveCITY is a grassroots collaboration of not-for-profit, for-profit and public-sector organizations and individuals engaged in Calgary&amp;rsquo;s regional active economy. The objective of ActiveCITY is to facilitate collaboration, debate, learning and connection to identify important issues, solve system-wide challenges, and articulate the financial and non-financial impacts of this active economy for Calgary.
In this working paper, we will use the definition of the &amp;lsquo;active economy&amp;rsquo; as that which incorporates all organizations who participate in, or contribute to, improving individual and/or community level well-being through the development and delivery of sport, physical activity and active recreation experiences.</description>

      <title>Alberta&#39;s Long-Term Fiscal Future</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/fiscal-future/</link>

      <description>Abstract Alberta&amp;rsquo;s fiscal policies are unsustainable.
The province has neither a revenue problem nor a spending problem; it has a budget problem. An aging population will increase government spending significantly, and tax revenue will fail to keep pace. A persistent dependence on resource royalties adds to the uncertainty. And even if current plans to balance early in the next decade succeed, fiscal pressures will mount and deficits balloon.
This paper examines long-term projections for resource royalties, federal transfer payments, investment income, property taxes, tuition revenue, health and education spending and debt service costs, and forecasts a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040.</description>

      <title>Opening Canada&#39;s North: A Study of Trade Costs in the Territories</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/north/</link>

      <description>Abstract Challenged by remote locations, small populations, rugged terrain and (at times) difficult climate conditions, Canada&amp;rsquo;s territories rely heavily on imported goods to maintain their standards of living. At the same time, industries in the territories are highly reliant on access to export markets - especially the large and growing resource sectors of the region. But these trade flows face significant costs that improved infrastructure may help mitigate. A northern transportation corridor could help, and has recently gained prominence following recent reports and hearings by the Senate of Canada.</description>
