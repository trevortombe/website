      <title>[23]	Roadblocks ahead: Internal barriers to trade in Canada&#39;s truck transportation sector </title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/mli_trucks/</link>

      <description>Canada&amp;rsquo;s truck transportation sector faces significant economic and legal challenges due to internal trade barriers. These barriers, which include varying regulations across provinces, add approximately 8.3 percent to freight rates, thereby inflating business costs and reducing overall productivity in the economy. This report discusses the potential for a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) as a way to alleviate these obstacles, thereby enhancing economic integration and boosting Canada&amp;rsquo;s productivity and real GDP.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Our debt is dead,&amp;rdquo; declared a front-page Calgary Herald headline on July 13, 2004 (Hudes, 2021). The paper was covering a famous event in Alberta&amp;rsquo;s fiscal history: Premier Ralph Klein holding a &amp;ldquo;Paid in Full&amp;rdquo; sign high above his head, marking the end of a 10-year plan to eliminate provincial debt as detailed in Budget 1994. To be clear, Alberta was not literally debt free, but by March 31, 2005, it was projected that the province&amp;rsquo;s Debt Retirement Account would have sufficient assets ($3.</description>

      <title>Liberalizing internal trade through mutual recognition: A legal and economic analysis</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/mli_trade/</link>

      <description>In Canada, provincial and territorial governments have constitutionally enshrined powers that give them considerable jurisdiction over the standards, rules, regulations, and certifications that govern goods and services. These regulatory divergences can and do affect interprovincial trade by making it difficult for goods, services, labour, and capital to flow across borders. These barriers can make it more expensive for consumers in one region to purchase goods and services produced in another, and as a result increase costs and lower Canada&amp;rsquo;s overall productivity.</description>

About the Book
The first scholarly analysis of the 2019 Alberta Election, which led to the victory of Jason Kenney&amp;rsquo;s United Conservative Party, and of the UCP&amp;rsquo;s first years in government.
In 2019, the United Conservative Party, under the leadership of Jason Kenney, unseated the New Democratic Party to form the provincial government of Alberta. A restoration of conservative power in a province that had seen the Progressive Conservatives win every election from 1971-2015, UCP quickly began to make political waves.</description>

Created in 1957, the federal equalization program addresses the issue of horizontal fiscal imbalance and, more specifically, seeks to reduce interprovincial disparities in fiscal capacity. Excluding the three territories, which fall under Territorial Formula Financing, the equalization program allocates payments to the provinces whose fiscal capacity falls under a national average.</description>

      <title>Alberta&#39;s Opportunity: The Ins, Outs and Benefits of Greater Job Mobility</title>

      <description>Study in Brief
Alberta should open its doors to job seekers with labour mobility reforms that will boost its economic fortunes post-COVID. The province has a unique opportunity to promote economic revival and longterm economic growth by ensuring that it is the most welcoming jurisdiction to talented workers and entrepreneurs from across Canada.
The gains from easing labour mobility restrictions are large. In this report, we find that for each 1,000 additional workers that move into Alberta in response to lower migration costs we estimate Alberta&amp;rsquo;s economy grows by 141 million dollars.</description>

      <description>This working paper is the first output of the ActiveCITY Collective. ActiveCITY is a grassroots collaboration of not-for-profit, for-profit and public-sector organizations and individuals engaged in Calgary&amp;rsquo;s regional active economy. The objective of ActiveCITY is to facilitate collaboration, debate, learning and connection to identify important issues, solve system-wide challenges, and articulate the financial and non-financial impacts of this active economy for Calgary.
In this working paper, we will use the definition of the &amp;lsquo;active economy&amp;rsquo; as that which incorporates all organizations who participate in, or contribute to, improving individual and/or community level well-being through the development and delivery of sport, physical activity and active recreation experiences.</description>

      <title>Alberta&#39;s Long-Term Fiscal Future</title>
      <link>https://www.trevortombe.com/publication/fiscal-future/</link>

      <description>Abstract Alberta&amp;rsquo;s fiscal policies are unsustainable.
The province has neither a revenue problem nor a spending problem; it has a budget problem. An aging population will increase government spending significantly, and tax revenue will fail to keep pace. A persistent dependence on resource royalties adds to the uncertainty. And even if current plans to balance early in the next decade succeed, fiscal pressures will mount and deficits balloon.
This paper examines long-term projections for resource royalties, federal transfer payments, investment income, property taxes, tuition revenue, health and education spending and debt service costs, and forecasts a deficit of almost $40 billion by 2040.</description>

      <title>Opening Canada&#39;s North: A Study of Trade Costs in the Territories</title>

      <description>Abstract Challenged by remote locations, small populations, rugged terrain and (at times) difficult climate conditions, Canada&amp;rsquo;s territories rely heavily on imported goods to maintain their standards of living. At the same time, industries in the territories are highly reliant on access to export markets - especially the large and growing resource sectors of the region. But these trade flows face significant costs that improved infrastructure may help mitigate.
