This report investigates the effects of emissions pricing, such as the federal fuel charge or B.C. carbon tax. It focuses on how these policies impact households differently based on their income levels, regions and family types. The analysis is set against the backdrop of rising inflation, particularly between June 2021 and June 2022, when consumer prices rose sharply. One of the key concerns we address is whether emissions pricing significantly contributes to overall cost increases and how government measures, such as rebates, can help ease the financial burden on households.
