This working paper is the first output of the ActiveCITY Collective. ActiveCITY is a grassroots collaboration of not-for-profit, for-profit and public-sector organizations and individuals engaged in Calgary's regional active economy. The objective of ActiveCITY is to facilitate collaboration, debate, learning and connection to identify important issues, solve system-wide challenges, and articulate the financial and non-financial impacts of this active economy for Calgary. 

In this working paper, we will use the definition of the 'active economy' as that which incorporates all organizations who participate in, or contribute to, improving individual and/or community level well-being through the development and delivery of sport, physical activity and active recreation experiences. We propose this definition will then incorporate ten interdependent sectors including organized sport, active recreation, health & wellness, design & infrastructure and tourism.

The ActiveCITY Collective is inclusive, bridging everyone including volunteer coaches, entrepreneurs, educators, policymakers and parents, and in areas ranging from Tai Chi to gardening and hockey to the development of emerging sport technology. What we all share is a passion for the unique role that the active economy can play in moving our city forward. The goal of this working paper then is to begin a discussion on how the active economy can play a leading role in shaping Calgary's future. Over the next year, the ActiveCITY Collective will establish an ambitious goal of being the broadest public engagement in the city's history. We hope that ActiveCITY acts as a conduit to enable the shared goal of maximizing the impact and value of our regional active economy, thereby transforming Calgary and the surrounding area into Canada's most livable region.
