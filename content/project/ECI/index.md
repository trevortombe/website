This index compiles monthly data from a variety of sourses to estimate real-time economic conditions in Alberta. It closely follows the Chicago Fed National Activity Index. These estimates will be periodically updated, and typically come with a two to three month lag before all the necessary monthly data is available from Statistics Canada.

You can download a CSV file of the montly index values [here](https://github.com/trevortombe/alberta_eci/raw/master/ECI_Index_Data.csv).
