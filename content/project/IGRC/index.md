There is an urgent need to re-assess federal, provincial and municipal expenditure responsibilities, tax powers, and intergovernmental transfers in Canada to address looming fiscal imbalances. To address these ongoing concerns, a steering committee made up of academics and policy researchers from across Canada has proposed an Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations Commission. An independent team of academic experts and policy practitioners from a variety of disciplines across the country will recommend practical reforms to the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations in Canada. Like a Royal Commission, it will take a coordinated deep dive into complex questions; unlike a Royal Commission it would be independent of government appointments or political priorities. Once established, the Commission will publish research papers, policy briefs and op-eds and make recommendations for the reform of fiscal relations among the federal, provincial and municipal governments within the framework of the existing Canadian Constitution.

The main site for the project is at the [Canada West Foundation](https://cwf.ca/research/publications/intergovernmental-fiscal-relations-commission/).
