# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Since the federal election saw the Conservatives sweep all but one seat across Alberta and Saskatchewan, talk of 'Wexit' has ramped up.  Trevor Tombe suggests that rather than focusing political frustrations on talks of separation and equalization, fixes to some federal-provincial fiscal arrangements might result in more concrete changes for the West. CABE is very fortunate that Dr.  Tombe, a leading expert on fiscal transfers, will present an overview of the current issues surrounding equalization and federal/provincial transfers. 1pm EST (11am MST).  Dr. Tombe is the author of a comprehensive review of fiscal transfers published in the Canadian Tax Journal and a recent paper on the role of carbon taxes in the current structure of equalization published in CPP."
