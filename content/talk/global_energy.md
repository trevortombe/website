abstract = "The economic case for a carbon tax is compelling. Yet the political appeal of a carbon tax is weak. In 2018 we saw violent protests in France against the fuel tax hike and the defeat of the 2018 Carbon Fee Initiative in the State of Washington. Can carbon taxes be designed to be more politically acceptable? Do societies need to think of other policy instruments to address climate change? What are the strategies to make climate policy speak to everyday concerns of all stakeholders?"
