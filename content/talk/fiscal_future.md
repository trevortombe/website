abstract = "Albertans are concerned about the province's fiscal situation. Budget deficits and a rising provincial debt cast a cloud over Alberta's future. Building on its successful breakfast symposium last September, The School of Public Policy will hold a daylong conference that will provide an in-depth review of Alberta's fiscal situation and options for balancing the provincial budget. Solving Alberta's fiscal challenges is a complex problem. There are many options that need to be carefully considered. Fiscal policy research helps Albertans, government officials, and politicians understand the consequences and trade-offs from the actions that could be taken to address Alberta unsustainable fiscal situation. Join The School of Public Policy in Edmonton for this important discussion. Click [HERE](http://em.ucalgary.ca/qTNO0G0VKH080s10L0YT00F) to view the full program."
