abstract = "As the October federal election nears, and as a business leader, who has your support? How does one candidate's platform differ from the next? What is their stance on issues affecting your business? To answer these important queries and more, the **Alberta Chamber of Commerce**, **Edmonton Chamber of Commerce**, and the **REALTORS Association of Edmonton** are proud to host a unique Federal Election Forum & Candidate Meet-and-Greet. Upon arrival, you will be invited to upstairs, throughout CuriousCITY - inspired by iconic Edmonton landmarks, to engage in open discussions with electoral candidates from the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. This is guests' opportunity to express key areas impacting your business or industry. Following the candidate mixer, there will be a lively panel discussion in the newly renovated Zeidler Dome. Hosted by Edmonton's **Ryan Jespersen**, political experts will discuss party platforms, electoral projections and hold a Q&A with attendees - uncovering how the outcome of the federal election can impact Albertans and business in the province."
