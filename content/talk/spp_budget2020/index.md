On February 27, the Alberta Government will table their second budget, one that will again lead to questions from Albertans about whats in store now for spending restraint and the way health care, education and social services are delivered. The School of Public Policy has assembled a panel of experts who will discuss what this new budget means, and what impacts Albertans are likely to see. Join us for this breakfast event, where we will discuss the general direction of the Government of Alberta'''s fiscal policies and strategies."
