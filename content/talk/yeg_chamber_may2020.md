In this edition of Advocacy A.M., we will welcome Trevor Tombe, Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Calgary, to share his insights. He will discuss the depth and scale of the disruption in the labour market and the economy. Then joined by Edmonton Chamber's Director of Advocacy and Outreach, they will dive into the latest data to explore the challenges with reopening and what we know so far.

Following his presentation, you will have an opportunity to ask questions directly to Trevor; bring your queries about the economy, fiscal impact of COVID-19 or anything in between!  

**Please confirm your attendance by Monday, June 1 @ 4 PM.**
We will be using the Zoom meeting platform for the webinar. A link to join the meeting will be sent out to all registrants 12-24 hours prior to the webinar via email.
