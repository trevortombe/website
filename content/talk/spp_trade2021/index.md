abstract = "The post-COVID economic recovery is on the minds of many Canadians. What can our governments do to help restart the economy while not incurring further major debt? One action is to reduce interprovincial barriers to businesses - lowering costs and adding GDP. It's a story as old as Canada.  Outdated and inefficient barriers are hurting us, especially in fields like agriculture. Join The Simpson Centre at The School of Public Policy for a discussion about why these barriers exist, what the magnitude of lost GDP potentially is and what actions could be taken to reduce them. We will discuss the issue in general terms and then focus on the impact specifically on Canada's agriculture industry, and how changes to these policies could help the country's economic recovery."
