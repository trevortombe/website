Alberta finds itself in new territory as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising debt levels, falling natural resource revenues, and structural changes to the economy suggests that this time is different. A long-term perspective is required to ensure that the province's economy and government finances remain sustainable into the future.

We invite you to join The School of Public Policy as we host the first in a series of webinars on our Alberta Futures Project. As part of this project we will be releasing a series of reports over the coming weeks in three broad areas: Alberta's Economic Future, Alberta's Fiscal Future and Alberta's Health Care Future. In this webinar, our panel of experts will discuss their recent research into the Fiscal Future of Alberta, and how we can address the challenges currently facing our economy.
