# Biography

Welcome to my website. I'm a Professor of Economics at the University of Calgary and the Director of Fiscal and Economic Policy at The School of Public Policy. I am also Co-Director of [Finances of the Nation](https://financesofthenation.ca/). My academic research explores a broad range of topics, but focuses mainly on international trade, macroeconomics, fiscal federalism, and public policy. In addition to this work, I actively contribute to public policy research and outreach in Alberta and Canada.
