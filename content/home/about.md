# Biography

Welcome to my website. I'm an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Calgary and a Research Fellow at The School of Public Policy. Prior to joining the University of Calgary in 2012, I was an Assistant Professor of Economics at Wilfrid Laurier University. My academic research explores a broad range of topics, but focuses mainly on international trade, macroeconomics, and fiscal federalism questions. In addition to this work, I actively contribute to public policy research and outreach in Alberta and Canada.
