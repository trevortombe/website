<p>The <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/disclosure-policy">American Economic Association</a> urges its members and other economists to disclose potential conflicts of interest through financial support (whether in monetary or non-monetary forms), paid or unpaid positions as officers, directors, or board members of non-profit or for-profit organizations, and if other interested third parties have financial, ideological, or political stakes in their work.</p>
<p>This is a best efforts disclosure based on the most recent five years of activity. More detail around my past professional affiliations, associations, and activities are listed on <a href="https://www.trevortombe.com/files/CV.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>

<h2>Sources of Financial Support</h2>
<p>According to the AEA disclosure policy, authors “should identify each interested party from whom he or she has received significant financial support, summing to at least $10,000 in the past three years, in the form of consultant fees, retainers, grants and the like.” I report these below, separating ongoing sources from one-time ad-hoc sources.
