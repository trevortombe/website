The [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/disclosure-policy) urges its members and other economists to disclose potential conflicts of interest through financial support (whether in monetary or non-monetary forms), paid or unpaid positions as officers, directors, or board members of non-profit or for-profit organizations, and if other interested third parties have financial, ideological, or political stages in the work. This includes "scholarly journals, op-ed pieces, newspaper and magazine columns, radio and television commentaries, as well as in testimony before federal and state/provincial legislative committees and other agencies." My disclosure follows.

**NOTE:** All relevant affiliations and associations are disclosed on my CV and will not be duplicated here.

## Sources of Financial Support

I separately report ongoing financial support from one-time ad-hoc amounts. According to the AEA disclosure policy, authors "should identify each interested party from whom he or she has received significant financial support, summing to at least $10,000 in the past three years, in the form of consultant fees, retainers, grants and the like." I report these below. In addition, for completeness, I report relevant minor sources of financial support.
