The [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/disclosure-policy) urges its members and other economists to disclose potential conflicts of interest through financial support (whether in monetary or non-monetary forms), paid or unpaid positions as officers, directors, or board members of non-profit or for-profit organizations, and if other interested third parties have financial, ideological, or political stakes in their work.

My disclosure follows, based on the most recent five years of activity. More detail around my past professional affiliations, associations, and activities are listed on [my CV](https://www.trevortombe.com/files/CV.pdf).
