Each month Statistics Canada releases their [`Labour Force Survey`](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/survey/household/3701). This is the main source of information on the latest labour market trends throughout Canada.

A selection of some of my graphical analysis, based on the latest data, is available [`here`](LFS.html).

Selected statistics for Calgary and Edmonton are [`here`](LFS_cma.html)
